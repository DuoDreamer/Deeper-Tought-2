#Deeper Thought 2
A program that blinks the LEDs on the PiDP-8 kit created by Oscar Vermeulen. This program is C++ and does not run in the PDP-8 simulator. The default mode is designed to be similar to Steve Gibson's Deep Thought program for the PDP-8. For more information the the PiDP-8 kits [go here](http://obsolescence.wix.com/obsolescence#!pidp-8/cbie).
Deeper Thought 2 is a fork of Deeper Thought by Norman Davie.  For the original program, [go here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pidp-8/tbciVNoZJbw/AMjywRKLAwAJ).  The file gpio.c and gpio.h were copied from Oscar Vermeulen's PDP-8/simH project.
